# Zippyshare Indexer

How to use:

1. You first need to download the index files from Web Archive, it may take a few minutes (5-10) to download them all but it will eventually download them (there are 1,821 files to be downloaded, if you are missing some, please restart and re-download them).

2. Next you can search the keyword or the end of the link (e.g zZMvictk/file.html) for the Zippyshare file you want, it may take 30-60 seconds to search.

3. Now you need to open the output text file that should now be in the same directory, and you should have a list of index files that contain the keyword or link.

4. To get the archive that contains your keyword/zippyshare file, you can copy the "zippyshare_date_archive" (e.g zippyshare_20230327005729_877b04b6) part of the output.

5. Now you take the "zippyshare_date_archive" and paste it at the end of this link: "https://archive.org/details/archiveteam_", it should look something like this now: "https://archive.org/details/archiveteam_zippyshare_20230327005729_877b04b6"

6. Now you download the WARC file or the Web Archive GZ file and extract it using a program (e.g https://github.com/webrecorder/replayweb.page/releases) and you can find your file in there.
